# StrengthHub
This was my CapStone project for my final year at PennState.  The goal was to create a platform for lifting coaches to mentor their athletes.  The modle would be simular to how linkedIn would work.  I worked in a team of 4 and we were tasked with creating a mobile app and a website.  I was the one incharge of creating the website for the newly founded company StrengthHub
